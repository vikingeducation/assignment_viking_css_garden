Viking CSS Garden
============================

This was an assignment for Viking Code School's advanced prep work. I was provided an HTML framework and used CSS to style the page.

You can view the actual pages published <a href="http://viking-css-aws.surge.sh/" target="_blank">here</a>.
You can view a blog post explaining my styling <a href="https://austinwsmith.wordpress.com/2017/05/06/viking-css-garden/" target="_blank">here</a>.

A place for your styling creativity to grow.
