I tried to use simple flat design around the bungee-shade font. I went with light blues and greens because the bungee-shade sign is like a neon sign during the day with the sky as a background. The colors also look aquatic. I also like the barbaric-cartoon-hercules style of the bungee fonts, which I thought would go with the mythology theme. I found the complementary fonts on a google fonts suggested paring.
